Metallb-dyn6
===========

Dynamic Ipv6 prefix support for MetalLB

Notes:
- This chart **must** be installed in the same namespace as MetalLB! (Cross-namespace access through RBAC is not supported yet)
- This chart automatically sets up a ServiceAccount and RoleBinding with edit access to the MetalLB namespace
## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the Metallb-dyn6 chart and their default values.

| Parameter                | Description             | Default        |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------- |
| `image.repository` | Full path to the image file in the container registry | `"quay.io/spacebird-dev/metallb-dyn6"` |
| `image.pullPolicy` |  | `"IfNotPresent"` |
| `image.tag` | Optionally specify a custom tag. Defaults to the Chart appVersion | `""` |
| `imagePullSecrets` |  | `[]` |
| `nameOverride` |  | `""` |
| `fullnameOverride` |  | `""` |
| `loglevel` | Application loglevel. Can be error,warning,info,debug,trace | `"info"` |
| `dyn6.source` | Source of the dynamic IPv6 network that will be injected into MetalLB. Can only be `my-ip` at this point. | `"my-ip"` |
| `dyn6.subnetOverride.enabled` | Whether to enable the subnet override. Both override and prefix_length must be set if this is true. | `false` |
| `dyn6.subnetOverride.override` | Override a portion of the prefix (usually the subnet). This value must be a valid IPv6 address. For example, to set the subnet to :beef: with a /48 dynamic prefix, use: 0:0:0:beef:: | `"0:0:0:00aa"` |
| `dyn6.subnetOverride.prefixLength` | Length of the original network prefix that should be preserved when overriding the subnet with --subnet-override. For example, if you have a /48 prefix and are overriding the subnet with :beef:, set this to 48. | `56` |
| `dyn6.updateInterval` | Time between attempts to refresh the dynamic Prefix and updating the IPAddressPool in seconds | `60` |
| `metallb.hostRange` | Range of host addresses that MetalLB can use for allocating services. Must be passed as a range of Ipv6-Host-parts, such as ::1000-::1999 | `""` |
| `metallb.pool` | Name of the IPAddressPool resource to manage | `""` |
| `metallb.podsLabelSelector` | Use this label selector to filter pods when force-deleting MetalLB to refresh its configuration. Only pods that match this selector will be deleted. Only adjust this if your MetalLB instance is installed with a custom label name/instance. | `"app.kubernetes.io/name=metallb,app.kubernetes.io/instance=metallb"` |
| `serviceAccount.annotations` | Annotations to add to the created ServiceAccount | `{}` |
| `serviceAccount.name` | The name of the service account that metallb-dyn6 should use to update MetalLB. If not set, a name is generated using the fullname template | `""` |
| `role.annotations` | Annotations to add to the created Role | `null` |
| `role.name` | The name of the Role that will be created to let metallb-dyn6 update MetalLB. If not set, a name is generated using the fullname template | `""` |
| `roleBinding.annotations` | Annotations to add to the created RoleBinding | `{}` |
| `roleBinding.name` | The name of the RoleBinding that will be created for metallb-dyn6. If not set, a name is generated using the fullname template | `""` |
| `podAnnotations` | Additional annotations for pod resources | `{}` |
| `podSecurityContext` | Additional security context for pod resources | `{}` |
| `securityContext` | Additional security context for this chart | `{}` |
| `labels` |  | `null` |
| `resources` | Optional resource limits for resources in this chart | `{}` |
| `nodeSelector` |  | `{}` |
| `tolerations` |  | `[]` |
| `affinity` |  | `{}` |
